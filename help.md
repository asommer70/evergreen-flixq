## Netflix URL

To find the RSS feed URL for your Netflix DVD Queue open your browser and go to [netflix.com](http://netflix.com). If you are on a phone you 
may see the mobile version of the website, but we want the full version.  Scroll down to the bottom and click the <strong>"View Full Site"</strong> 
link pictured below:

Now that you are at the full site, scroll to the bottom and click the <strong>"RSS Feeds"</strong> link.

On the Feeds page the link we are looking for is the <strong>"Queue"</strong> link.
Go ahead and give it a clicky click (or touchy touch as the case may be).

<img src="/img/rss_feeds.png" width="400"/>

You should now see a page with a lot of funny text, this is exactly the page 
we are looking for. Go to the address bar of the browser and <strong>copy</strong> the entire URL.

Finally, open Evergreen FlixQ back up and <b>paste</b> the URL into the Netflix RSS URL text box.


## Evergreen URL

To find the URL for your local, or statewide, library open a web browser and go to your libraries website. There is usually a link for the
"Search Catalog", "Library Catalog", or wherever you can search for things.

**Note:** your library has to use the Evergreen ILS system for this app to work.

Once you have found the link to your library's Evergreen **copy** the base part of the URL. See the example highlighted below:

<img src="/img/evergreen_url.png" width="400"/>


Now just **paste** that sweet text into the **"Library Search URL"** text box back in the Evergreen FlixQ app.

Hurray! With both URLs configured you can now lookup DVDs in your Netflix Queue at your library. Should help pare that monster down 
(or maybe I'm the only one with over 100 DVDs in their queue hmmmmm).
